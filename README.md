# Financial-Inclusion-In-East-Africa
This project aims to build machine learning models to predict individuals with a higher likelihood of owning/using a bank account. By doing so in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, it provides insights into factors affecting financial security and measures financial inclusion across these regions.
